## Objectives  
  
1. Facilitate an exchange of assessment ideas within a group of educators.  
2. Provide a low-stakes, safe space for educators to give and receive feedback on assessments for their courses.  
3. Initiate long-term connections between educators across different disciplines.  
  
  
## How It Works  
  

  

## Schedule  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
schedule <- as_tibble(read.csv("files/schedule.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
kable(schedule) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```
